      <h2>Introduction to the Winter Solstice</h2>
      <p>
        The winter solstice is a significant astronomical event that marks the
        shortest day and the longest night of the year. It occurs annually in
        December in the Northern Hemisphere and in June in the Southern
        Hemisphere. This event has been observed and celebrated by cultures
        around the world for thousands of years, often symbolizing rebirth,
        reflection, and the triumph of light over darkness.

      <h2>The Science Behind the Solstice</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            The solstices occur due to the Earth's axial tilt of approximately
            23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt
            causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of
            sunlight throughout the year, leading to the changing seasons.
            During the winter solstice, one hemisphere is tilted the farthest
            away from the Sun, resulting in the shortest period of daylight.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the exact moment of the solstice, the Sun reaches its lowest
            maximum elevation in the sky. In the Northern Hemisphere, this
            happens around December 21st or 22nd, when the Sun is directly over
            the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5 degrees south latitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solstice is a precise moment in time, but its effects are felt
            throughout the day. The term "solstice" comes from the Latin words
            "sol" (sun) and "sistere" (to stand still), because the Sun's
            apparent movement north or south comes to a stop before reversing
            direction.

            <h3>Northern Hemisphere</h3>
            <p>
              In the Northern Hemisphere, the December solstice marks the
              beginning of winter. Countries like the United States, Canada,
              Russia, and much of Europe experience their shortest day and
              longest night. The weather typically becomes colder, and many
              cultures have developed traditions to bring light and warmth into
              this dark time of year.

            <p>
              Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, the December solstice
              signals the start of summer. Nations such as Australia, South
              Africa, and Argentina enjoy their longest day and shortest night.
              This time is associated with warmth, outdoor activities, and
              often, summer vacations.

            The prehistoric monument of Newgrange is aligned with the rising sun
            on the winter solstice. Built over 5,000 years ago, it predates
            Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. Each year, a beam of sunlight
            illuminates the inner chamber, symbolizing the victory of light over
            darkness.
